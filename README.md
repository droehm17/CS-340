Client/Server Development

These files cover using MongoDB to create a CRUD file and an application to view datapoints from the AnimalShelter file.

In order to write programs that are maintainable, readable and adaptable is to practice using organizational code structure so it is easy to read, and ensure to use comments when at all possible so others in the future can easily understand how your code is constructed. Starting out with the CRUD module did help bring the MongoDB elements together with the Jupyter notebook files. After getting setup, it is easier to use Jupyter to construct programs and to implement other ways to use the CRUD module such as easily switch between different databases and make changes on the fly. I encountered alot of problems throughout this course. The best way to work with problems is to work with one section of code at a time, instead of implementing multiple features. Programming this way allows the programmer to easily identify where the error is coming from. I approached this project by focusing on one item at a time, such as adding the image. When that was working I would would on the next section. In my limited experience, Computer Scientists are problem solvers and also provide UI experiences that make clients lives easier, for this example it made Grazioso Salvare view their data in a productive way using charts instead of the terminal using MongoDB.
